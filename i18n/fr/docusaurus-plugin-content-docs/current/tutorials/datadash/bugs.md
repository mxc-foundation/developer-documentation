# How to report DataDash Bugs

The DataDash app codebase is [Publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/mxc-foundation/supernode-app). Therefore the best way to submit a DataDash bug, is directly as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mxc-foundation/supernode-app/issues).

Please include the following information in your bug report:

* What is the problem?
* What is the expected behavior?
* Mark the issue with the appropriate labels:
  * `bug`
  * `ios` or `android`
* Provide any additional information, screenshots, or videos you believe might be helpful.

**GitHub Issues are public! Do not share any personal or identifiable information. If you believe the issue is specific to you, it should be submitted as a support ticket to [support@mxc.org](mailto:support.mxc.org).**
