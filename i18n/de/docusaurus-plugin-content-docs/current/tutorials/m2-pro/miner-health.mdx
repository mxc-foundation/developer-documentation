# Miner Health

Miner Health rewards users for placing their miner in a fashion that will provide a strong LoRa signal. These are the six items that make up miner health:
* Fuel (Live)
* Uptime (Live)
* GPS Signal
* Orientation
* Proximity
* Altitude

## Miner Health Grace Period
Each M2 Pro Miner has a 90-day grace period that begins with the initial registration of the miner. During this period of time, health will not affect the mining potential of the M2 Pro. After the grace period is over, the current health of the miner will be applied.

If the fuel tank is empty after the grace period, mining efficiency will be reduced by 50% (see Fuel).

## Fuel (Live)
Each miner has a fuel tank. This tank is equal to the size of all the MXC mined by this miner. So a miner mined 10 MXC, the tank size would then be 10 MXC.

*Fuel has a 50 percent influence on your mining potential*

### How does this work?

As a miner mines, it maintains the fuel tank. All newly mined MXC are added to the tank to ensure it continues to mine at peek efficiency. When MXC is removed from the fuel tank, the miner will mine at a reduced efficiency. For example, if all MXC would be removed from the fuel tank, the miner would mine at 50% efficiency.

### Fuel percentage increases over time
As a miner mines, it continues to add MXC. If a miner's tank size is 99 MXC, and all the fuel is removed from the tank, then the fuel percentage would be zero. However, if the miner mines one MXC on the following day, the fuel balance increases by one MXC, as does the tank size, resulting in a 1% fuel capacity. Naturally this version of "refilling" the tank takes time, however it ensure that the M2 Pro retains its value after all fuel is removed.

## Uptime
Uptime is a reliability metric calculated using the average reliability of the miner over the past 7 days. Uptime as a whole, has a 20 percent influence on miner health.

## GPS Signal
GPS is another form of wireless signal. Therefore we can *assume* that if the miner has a strong GPS signal, it's positioned well enough to provide an excellent wireless network. *GPS has a 10 percent influence on miner health.*

## Orientation
An M2 Pro antenna provides a wireless signal to the sides of the miner. If the miner is mounted horizontally, the network that it provides will be extremely limited (i.e. airplanes and moles would benefit when they pass overhead or underneath the miner). Therefore, orientation ensures a miner is mounted vertically as designed, with the antenna facing upwards. *Orientation has an 8 percent influence on miner health.*

## Proximity
In order to achieve a broad wireless network, and in doing so get the most possible coverage, proximity rewards users for spreading out their miners. If a miner is in close proximity with another miner, then it will receive a proximity hit on miner health. *Proximity has a 7 percent influence on miner health.*

## Altitude
A miner placed in a higher position is more likely to provide a wireless network that transverses physical obstacles. Altitude is measured by using the pressure sensor in the miner itself, and combining it with a terrain elevation database to determine how high above ground level the miner is. This is then cross referenced with the elevation of nearby miners to determine whether the miner is ideally placed. *Altitude has a 5 percent influence on miner health.*

### Proposed alternative to altitude
As altitude is extremely difficult to measure, we are considering a method for users to manually measure the signal strength of a miner.
