## 1. MXC Vision

> The MXC vision is to introduce a systematic process to both simplify and
> increase IoT data transactions.

The decentralized infrastructure upon which MXC’s system is based is the future
of Low Power Wide Access Network (LPWAN) and the Machine eXchange Protocol
(MXProtocol). Utilizing this solid device network foundation, MXC is introducing
an extraordinarily unique coin offering, Machine eXchange Coin (MXC), which
allows for increased data transactions and an idiosyncratic data flow
monetization within the mammoth data market.

MXProtocol places a keen focus on reducing collision between networks,
constructing an inter-chain data market, developing a market for network
coverage and introducing an independent Quality of Services (QoS) framework for
both data providers and receivers. For the first time ever, individual network
users, corporations and enterprises can all participate in the construction of
decentralized, ubiquitous and secure LPWAN. Simply by connecting “anything” to
the network, adopters will be able to profit and trade MXC.

The trading network is built on the premise of the “sharing economy.” Therefore,
it is uniquely and exclusively owned by users — both individuals and enterprises
— who take advantage of the monetization of the network in two ways:

1. By increasing uplink and downlink coverage via a Gateway, e.g. a MatchBox
   LPWAN Gateway, Cisco LPWAN Gateway
2. By unleashing access to a massive network
   of published and traded data to the marketplace which is securely traded using
   blockchain technology

Both sensors and connected devices bid (via the integrated QoS) for the downlink
network resource to, for example, unlock a door or, alternatively, shut down a
faulty radiator, subsequently offering a market-devised price for the uncovered
regions. This ultimately increases data network coverage. “Things” can
autonomously pay each other with MXC tokens and get accredited by sharing the
data with different users/marketplaces.

There has been a phenomenal increase in the sourcing, collection and
transmission of big data within the past five years. Additionally, the
increasing use of artificial intelligence feeding off this data has assisted
people to simplify tedious tasks and to make better informed decisions on
everything from projecting a weather forecast, to saving household energy, to
even choosing the right music to play at home. The tone has now been set for
decades to come. Machines interacting with one another has seen a significant
increase over such a short period. This will only increase as our
interdependency on machines and machine learning grows and becomes ever more
significant in day to day life.

Whether for individuals or big companies, the need for a specified network
concentrating on machines and machine data is here to stay. It will play a
bigger part in supporting both individuals and businesses than ever before.
MXProtocol introduces the next generation of LPWAN with a superior IoT data
platform and a premium network experience, allowing for a simplified and
expedited way to create a secure and efficient solution for IoT.

The following sections elaborate on the unique advantages of MXProtocol,
including its components — permissionless blockchain, Smart Bidding,
Anti-Collision Coordinator and Inter-Chain Data Market — that make it a truly
innovative technology.

## 2. Background

MXC is a German non-profit organization based in the country’s start-up and
blockchain capital, Berlin. MXC is partnering with various LPWAN companies.
MXProtocol is a revolutionary design that solves the problem of LPWAN and
bridges the data gap between different infrastructures.

IoT is a hot topic that has been intently discussed for over a decade. The one
focus and premise of the IoT network is connecting “things” to the Internet and
collecting/using this data from the objects that can’t speak for themselves. The
application of this new founded, increased data is highly limited due to the
current methods offering low range and high power consumption. For example,
standard WiFi can generally reach an absolute maximum of around 100 meters, and
using 3G/4G consumes a significant amount of power, thus reducing effective
battery life and increasing maintenance costs significantly. The fact is,
current implementations for data networks are extremely expensive and offer very
low usability. The need for a new technology is here and the need for LPWAN will
only increase as it solves the current problems of low range/high cost data
transmissions.

### 2.1 LPWAN vs other technologies

LPWAN technology emerged to the forefront in recent years with the goal of
finding a better data transmission solution to the shortfalls of WiFi, Bluetooth
and 3G & 4G networks. These earlier established networks were originally
targeted at connecting people, not at connecting the data generated by “things.”
The amount of machine-generated data has multiplied significantly in recent
times. The new LPWAN technology offers aspects where others simply can’t
compete:

- 10 year sensor battery life
- 20 km data reach with just a single Gateway
- Offers an extreme amount of connection points (over 60,000 for a single network
  cell) supported by LPWAN Gateways at an extremely low cost

Now, when compared to the current wireless network, it’s easy to see the
superior advancements that the MXC solutions offer. As illustrated in Figure 1,
LoRa and NB-IoT are simply the most potent solutions on the LPWAN market.

#### 2.1.1 LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN is an open-source protocol defined by the LoRa Alliance, which is
already supported by industrial giants such as Cisco, Alibaba, Comcast, IBM and
SK Telecom and many more. Advantages of LoRaWAN are 20 km open space coverage,
low data rates (low-level kbps) and ultra-low power, allowing for 10 years
continued operation on a single battery.

Both the Gateways and end sensor devices use the LoRaWAN protocol. In fact,
devices of any brand are supported and can be connected to the network as long
as they are LoRa/LPWAN compatible.

#### 2.1.2 NB-IoT

NB-IoT is a narrowband radio technology specified by 3GPP as a licensed
telecommuni- cation protocol. NB-IoT focuses specifically on indoor coverage,
low throughput and long battery life, enabling a large number of connected
devices.

The advantage for an MXC IoT user is that it gives an individual the power to
host their own network wherever and whenever they like. Compare that with the
NB-IoT base stations (which are owned by telecommunications conglomerates) which
charge users expensive SIM card fees to send data messages over the Internet
through NB-IoT protocol. MXProtocol supports all LPWAN technologies, developed
LoRaWAN Gateways, NB-IoT and LoRaWAN sensors. That’s decentralization. That’s
yet another MXC advantage.

#### 2.1.3 Deployment considerations

When deploying LPWAN, the first consideration is understanding how to avoid a col-
lision between different competing networks residing in the same region. Generally, the
issue comes from the fact that both may use the same channel to send out the message at
the same time and leave the other available channel empty due to the chosen preferences.
As a result, it’s generally hard to reach a consensus between these networks and thus the
deployment suffers as network usage increases. The decentralization and distributed mech-
anism of MXProtocol solves this issue by coordinating the networks. The network evolves
by having users pay micro-payments for the resources that another one offers.

The second concern is due to the shortage of downlink resources for the dense sensor/
end device deployment. Usually there are some sensors/end devices which require no
downlink or can bear with the loss of downlinks. This is usually associated with low-activity sensors, such as garbage bins or electricity meters. However, end devices like bike
locks or location tracker devices need to receive regular and reliable confirmations from
the cloud for every uplink. Hence, they are willing to pay a premium for this reliability
and a QoS provided by the networks. MXProtocol provides this bidding resource, ensuring
that, for example, a garbage bin sensor won’t take first preference over the vital downlink
resource of something like a bike lock.

Another consideration pertains to the requirements for multi-national cooperations (MNC)
and small to medium enterprises (SME) trading their data assets publicly generated using
LPWAN technology. Within LPWAN, both the data stream and asset trading features
are simplified, easy to read and can be digitally transmitted from many kilometers away.
This makes the data exchange a clear necessity for the needs of the LPWAN market of
tomorrow.

With respect to the needs of MNCs or SMEs, it’s likely that such enterprises will wish to
deploy their own LPWAN to cover an entire city or a region for its own specific applica-
tions such as asset tracking (e.g. automobile) or sensor data management. This is a perfect
solution for “Big Business.” LPWAN technology delivers via its long reach ensuring that
sensor/end device uplink packets are securely received as per the protocol design.

This leads to one of the key aspects of the MXProtocol: bringing the monetization of data
services to the forefront. Using the MXProtocol, micro-payments within the LPWAN
infrastructure will be traded from third party sensors/end devices, ensuring data is conveniently, correctly and concisely transmitted in a secure manner, whilst being maintained
by the support of system administrators. The industry has been waiting for a decentralized
and consensus-based mechanism to improve the usability of LPWAN, and MXC is delivering.

MXC has designed this next generation LPWAN infrastructure using MXProtocol in
order to significantly boost the applications of blockchain and IoT within the real-world
context.

## MXC economy

Machine eXchange Coin (MXC) offers a unique and specifically designed decentralized
technological “Data Trade Network” to the global Token economy. Data can be shared on a
mass scale whilst ensuring complete end to end privacy. The MXC intends to be distributed
amongst data owners, data receivers and data network hosts, allowing for a facilitated
cross-over from a “commodity” based Coin into an everyday trading Coin currency.

### 3.1 Commerce network effect

Machine eXchange Coin is the first Token designed to bridge current commodity-based
trading of cryptocurrency tokens and the cash-based global economy. Utilizing the “sharing
economy,” MXC uses this as an axis, allowing large businesses, SMEs and individuals to
borrow or rent assets owned by someone else.

Individuals place LoRa-based protocol hardware in opportune positions in order to benefit
and profit from their locations and their decentralized LoRaWAN network. Businesses
benefit by using these user-based networks to send sensor/device data, building a new
“sharing economy.” Wallets are stored in the cloud allowing individuals to profit from
businesses sending sensor data via their LoRaWAN LPWAN. The coins are then sent and
traded from the sensor holders that MXProtocol addresses to the Gateway distributor.

MXProtocol gives network participants incentives to use, deploy and trade their network
elements. In addition to that, it is a people-owned secure and private network that won’t
suffer from public congestion like what Ethereum encountered with cryptokitties.

### 3.2 Asset-Backed Securitization

MXC has been highly successful with regards to the design and production of high-end
LPWAN hardware. Using the coins and sharing economy will allow for a massive influx
of shared sensor data amongst individuals and companies, giving better insights into consumer behavior, environmental impacts and machine-based optimizations.

With MXC, Asset-Backed Securitization (ABS) adds a completely new way for individuals
and companies to both trade and manage their data and physical assets. Current methods
see sensitive data easily being passed and reproduced to a number of parties without any
of them knowing that the data has potentially already been corrupted, seen and/or shared
amongst potential competitors/untrusted parties. MXC makes it possible for corporations
and individuals to track both physical goods and intangible data, ensuring that buyers/
receivers of the goods are the only party who have received the data/physical good, and for
this information to come from a qualified and reliable source.

By applying ABS, the individual data is allocated to one dedicated source. In contrast, a
buyer of a tangible paper certificate, for example, has no way of knowing that the same
certificate hasn’t been sold/reproduced and assigned to potentially multiple parties.

### 3.3 Data bloom

MXC is a blockchain-based decentralized platform designed to revolutionize three core
functions based around the basic financial theory: Lend, Send and Spend.

#### 3.3.1 MXC-assisted garbage collection

The future is here. The one constant in everyone’s life from now on will be the data
surrounding all of us. In the past such a statement referred to “people-generated data.”
However, times have changed. “Machine-generated data” is taking over at a phenomenal
rate.

The beauty of machine-based data, when compared with human-based data, is it doesn’t
sleep. Machine-based data is constant and it’s reliability is unmatched when compared with
any people-generated data. So why is this important?

Take, for example, a local city council. Their task is to ensure safety, security and general
well-being of the local city. One of these responsibilities includes simple tasks such as
garbage collection. The simple act of emptying city trash may seem like a monotonous task,
but it in fact requires planning and chain management: When do collections occur? How
often should trash collections occur? How many employees are required to empty garbage
cans across the city? MXC simplifies such tasks using MXProtocol.

Using sensor/end devices situated in garbage cans and allowing them to transmit device
data via a Gateway allows the city council to detect the levels of garbage built up within the
can. What does this mean for the council?

- Saving fuel: The council only needs to send out garbage trucks when necessary,
  as opposed to sending out trucks to check cans, irrespective of whether they are full
  or even completely empty.
- Saving wages: By only sending out employees at the moment a garbage can
  needs to be emptied, the council can then reallocate human resources, thus saving
  employee wages.
- Reducing traffic congestion: Garbage trucks are often frustrating for commuters.
  When parked on the side of the road, they can increase general traffic significantly.
  Being aware of the need for garbage removal in certain areas can reduce the need
  for trucks and allow for smoother traffic flows.

Many of these highlighted aspects make up the chain of events associated with what are
deemed to be “menial tasks” but, as shown, the flow on effect is quite significant. MXC IoT
is ready to solve such issues, allowing for simple tasks to be categorized and ensuring exact
resources are allocated only when needed.

#### 3.3.1 MXC-assisted car sharing

Using LoRaWAN sensor/end devices and Gateways can also reduce the cost of car sharing
partners.

Covering an entire city center in LPWAN allows individuals to simply build their own
completely independent network, free from telecommunications companies and net-
works charging exorbitant costs.

The benefits of doing this for a company such as a “car sharing” company allows them
to track their vehicles without the need to depend on Telecommunication coverage. Using
LPWAN significantly reduces the costs, especially when compared with the costs of tracking
using a SIM card.

In addition to GPS tracking, car doors can be locked and unlocked using LPWAN, increasing
security for users, all at a very low cost compared to current methods.

By bringing such key services, MXC provides transparency and greatly enhances customer
experience. MXC’s mission is to intensify data sharing whilst forging a unity between
those with finance and data service needs and those without finance but who have private
access to network integration and distribution, thus eliminating borders, intermediaries
and prejudices.

MXProtocol focuses on three foundational pillars:

- Extend and support the massive device data economy
- Utilize the decentralized “sharing economy”
- Trade of assets within the current coin economy

MXProtocol connects “things” utilizing a market-based economy, which adds a plethora
of new transmission points allowing more data to be shared, traded, sold and analyzed for
data mining.

Within the new decentralized MXC economy, everyone can profit from the sharing of
data; end to end encryption grants authorized usage of the data; and entire communities can
benefit from using their locations to act as a network facility to transport this data — trading
assets, profiting from the coin economy.

## 4. MXProtocol stack

MXProtocol infrastructure consists of both sensor and end devices, Gateway and cloud.
Sensors and end devices collect data from “things,” and send to the cloud via the Gateway.
This is uniquely designed to specifically be a decentralized solution allowing for everyone to
suit their/the market’s needs. The usability of the hardware has been specifically designed
as a “plug and play” solution, making installation simple without the need for a professional
configuration. It is designed to be easy to set up and easy to share data.

As the flow in [Figure 2](#fig2) demonstrates, LPWAN Gateways connect to each other to form
either a mesh network as a collective cloud or the Internet. The sensors or end devices
communicate with Gateways using LPWAN technology for bi-directional communication.
Notably, the sensors and end devices are not purely limited to a single LPWAN product. In
fact, any LoRaWAN compatible sensors are able to connect to the LPWAN network and
can start sending and receiving messages.

<a name="fig2"> </a>
<figure>
  <img src="./images/fig2_dataflow.png" alt="dataflow" width="70%" />
</figure>

MXProtocol facilitates the data and value flow of the LPWAN. Inside this
ecosystem, each sensor or end device has a MXC wallet address assigned to an
individual user. This is required in order to both pay for the network usage and
to receive money from selling the data and services. The sensor wallet is stored
in the cloud in order to maintain the LPWAN low-power requirements. This is also
due to the fact that the CPU is usually resource-constrained. The same wallet is
used as the Gateway wallet (also found in a user account and stored in the
cloud). This wallet will receive coins from uploading/downloading the data from
the cloud to the sensor and assists in paying for the other LPWAN’s resource or
data.

Coinciding with the current LPWAN infrastructure protocol, the data link between
the Gateway and sensor end devices is unregulated. As a result, there would be
no possibility to be rewarded for forwarding data from the sensor to cloud via
the Gateway, and ultimately the downlink resource would be limited, only being
allocated on a “first come, first served” basis. This system as is would
negatively impact low-level data procurement services offered by things such as
a door lock or car charging station system and would result in the data link not
being appropriately monetized. MXC LPWAN infrastructure solves such issues,
delivering the ultimate user experience to SMEs and MNCs.

</figure>

[Figure 3](#fig3) shows the detailed technical stack of the MXProtocol infrastructure.
The decentralized and autonomous LPWAN can be built on any permissionless
blockchain, such as IOTA, Stellar, Skywire and NEO.

Based on this, the Anti-Collision Coordinator between LPWANs, Smart Bidding and
Inter-chain data market are introduced to answer the LPWAN deployment considerations
mentioned in the previous chapter [see 2.1.3](#213-deployment-considerations).

### 4.1 Permissionless Blockchain

There are various kinds of blockchain. Anyone can use cryptographic keys, anyone can be
a node and join the network, and anyone can become a participant to service the network
and seek a reward. Participants can walk away from being a node, return if and when they
feel like it and get a full account of all network activity since they left.

In a permissionless blockchain, anyone can read the chain, anyone can make
legitimate changes and anyone can write a new block into the chain as long as
they follow the rules. Decisions on a permissionless blockchain are made by the
network participants. The protocol is based on a consensus protocol. The
permissionless blockchain provides a way to reach consensus without relying on a
closed system to accurately record financial transactions.

#### 4.1.1 Features

MXC built MXProtocol as an inclusive platform where all participants are
encouraged to contribute. MXProtocol is a distributed network protocol backed by
monetization of the resources and incentives from enterprises and individuals
based on permissionless blockchain. The permissionless blockchain design makes
MXProtocol efficient and independent: the more people use it, the more robust
the network will be.

The blockchain should have four key properties: decentralized control, low
latency, flexible trust, and asymptotic security. In other words, MXProtocol
should run on a permissionless blockchain that has:

- A true decentralized network.
- It has eliminated mining rewards.
- All transactions get confirmed quickly.
- There is an anti-spam role. There should be a preventive measure against nefarious users flooding the network (a DoS attack).

#### 4.1.2 Security and efficiency

Often, the speed and privacy of a network is the concern for SMEs and MNCs. Public
blockchains, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, often suffer from big computing slow downs,
practically grinding the systems to a halt, leading to a situation where the whole network
and the 51 percent resources can attack the blocks. There should be a blockchain providing
more privacy and efficiency for businesses and individuals collectively. MXProtocol needs
to be run on a secure and efficient blockchain that can provide the devices with good connectivity.

The MXC-introduced LPWAN application requires further fragmented and discrete
transactions for sensitive data and services in an IoT realm. That is why MXC
continues to develop upon the permissionless blockchain, making MXProtocol more
efficient and more suitable for the needs of LPWAN and IoT applications.

#### 4.1.3 Long-term adoptions

As previously stated, MXProtocol is a LPWAN platform protocol that brings
efficiency and robustness to the users. There are, however, still several
components inside permissionless blockchain itself that MXC feels necessary to
emphasize. For example, to ensure the long term stability of the LPWAN IoT
projects, continued research is still required with regards to the current data
interface. Real field deployment will need to be conducted in order to properly
satisfy the plethora of data streams connecting from the LPWAN sensors/end
devices and ensure they are routed to the network seamlessly.

## 5. Smart Bidding

Due to governmental regulations of the LPWAN spectrum, the downlink is a precious
resource that is closely guarded by sensors and end devices. The majority of the world uses
eight downlink channels for acknowledgement or confirmation of the sensor data, and
each channel usually has to wait anywhere from a few milliseconds up to a few minutes in
order to send another packet.

The downlink channels are fixed in the protocol and code, and the waiting time for each
downlink is dependent on the data rate of the sensor/end device. A key side note to this
point is that LPWAN Gateways use the latest in “Listen Before Talk” technology allowing
them to send data more regularly. This means that data may be sent when the channel is
free, and therefore doesn’t have to wait for a specific time period to elapse.

### 5.1 Goals of design

To further overcome such industry-wide issues, MXProtocol implements a bidding
mechanism, designed to bring the needed resources to those devices that are
willing to bid the most. Generally public LPWAN deployment is pushed by both
individuals and corporations who do so in order to extend their own individual
network reach. Introducing a bidding mechanism will cause network reaches to
multiply due to the fact that users can both earn and learn from the data that
are sent by the sensors. The purpose of this section is to examine the Smart
Bidding design that would support a well-functioning LPWAN ecosystem. The goals
of the design are to:

- Allocate downlink resources adequately
- Allow all sensors/end devices to compete on a market platform for network resources
- Offer network deployments incentives, assisting them to monetize
- Ensure LPWAN services are monetized
- Power the decentralized ledger with MXProtocol to simplify and resolve any issues

### 5.2 Design and implementation

There are different bidding models, ranges and methods to be set in Smart Bidding. The
goal is to assign the network resource to the highest bidder. The design and functionality
of the Smart Bidding process is proposed in [Figure 4](#fig4). Sensors/end devices bid on one
single downlink channel out of the eight available on the LPWAN Gateway. The Smart
Bidding code sensors/end devices are hosted on the cloud code, enabling them to place a
bid. The LPWAN Gateway then provides the status of the network and provides resources
to the sensors/end devices.

In the example illustrated in in Figure 4, there are three sensors/end devices
are bidding on one single channel for the downlink resource. The sensor on the
right doesn’t participate in the auction due to the specification of its code.
Let’s say this is due to the sensor that is used for a minor purpose, e.g. to
monitor a garbage can or electricity meter, so the downlink confirmation can
acceptably be lost. This leaves the other two devices to bid for the downlink.
In this case, the door lock wins the auction. Should the downlink arrive, the
payment is then automatically sent from the sensor wallet to the Gateway wallet
which provided the resource.

Usually one Gateway offers eight channels for the sensors/end devices to bid and
the prices change dynamically due to the status of the Gateway, or
alternatively, the willingness of the sensors.

    width="70%"
  />
</figure>

### 5.3 Gateway status

Sensors and end devices will already be aware of the status of the Gateway in advance in
order to make an appropriate bid for the resources and the services that provided by the
network. To motivate the network administrator to maintain a robust LPWAN, we define
the following metrics of the Gateway to let sensors/end devices to bid for the dynamic
prices:

- Mean time between failures (MTBF)
- Number of downlink packets sent
- Gateway density
- List of services available

The first key parameter used to measure the stability of a Gateway on the network is
determined by measuring the down time. It is recommended that a smaller MTBF be used
than a larger one, because of the QoS that is required for the sensors. Thus, the high QoS
sensors/end devices are willing to pay for the more stable LPWAN Gateways.

The number of downlink packets sent by the Gateway represents the popularity of the
device. This usually means the end devices/sensors around the Gateway are dense. If a
sensor requires a downlink from the Gateway, which has a high number of downlink
packets, it will need to place a higher bid or increase the overall bidding range accordingly.

Gateway density is a parameter which is expected to motivate network administrators to
deploy more Gateways in the areas that have little to no coverage. As demonstrated, it’s
already clear that sensors will be willing to pay for low Gateway density with higher
prices. Low density means the downlink channels and the services are limited and that the
prices will be high when sensors are competing with each other. Overall, it’s expected that
this metric will push people to expand the network in order to provide better network
access to the LPWAN devices.

From time to time, LPWAN will provide a list of services, e.g. firmware upgrades,
GPS-free localization, network configuration optimization. This allows all hardware to be
regularly kept up to date. Sensors and end devices would then choose from the Gateway
bids for services, combined with the MTBF and the number of downlinks sent for the
auction.

### 5.4 Smart Bidding strategy

The following are the standard auction methods found in the system:

- Auction
  - Increase: When the initial bid fails, an increased bid is made in order to secure
    the auction.
  - Decrease: Similar to the Google Keyword style bidding auctions, the user states
    their bidding range. The system then states (considering all factors) the nec-
    essary bidding rate. In many instances, this will save customer coins.
- Fixed price
  - The network resource or service are offered at a fixed price, with limited or
    unlimited quantity. Sensors/end devices just pay per use.
- Quantitative purchase
  - The network resource or service are bid by quantitative metrics, like a period
    of time for downlink resource, the region of a whole city’s downlink and the
    amount of resources that are needed.

### 5.5 Sensor Smart Bidding code

Sensors and end devices are programmed with a snippet of code to enable them to bid for
network resources and services that are provided by Gateways. This is implemented on
the cloud so third party sensors can still use the logic easily by porting the code. There
are several parameters to receive from a Gateway in advance, such as the density of the
deployment and the list of services that are available to the sensors, just to name a few.

After the information has been obtained by the Gateway, sensors would bid for resources
of the service according to the type of the auction. For example, a bike lock would bid for a
downlink resource using the increase method. This specifies the range of the coins that the
bike lock is willing to pay for each transaction and the market dictates the end price.

A dedicated technical white paper about the logic, design and implementation of the Smart
Bidding will be released and the APIs with documentation will be available on the MXC
website.

```cpp
bid bike lock {

  /* Define the willingness to pay for the services or resources */
  type bidder

  /* Define the gateway status it will use for the auction */
  struct gw {
      uint mtbf;
      uint numdl;
      uint density;
      address service;

## 6. Anti-Collision Coordinator

With the increasing amount of LPWAN field deployments, the problem of network
congestion is anticipated to rapidly increase. This is especially so when the
network coverage targets ultra-long ranges of 20 km or more.

In 2020, there are expected to be more than 75 billion devices connected to the
Internet. If the majority of these are to use LPWAN, it can be assumed that it
would put quite a strain on the network resources. As a result, MXProtocol
infrastructure has bridged the gap between different networks using the
innovative protocol.

### 6.1 Goals of the design

> The MXProtocol also offers a
> general overwhelming consensus
> for all public LPWAN by adding a
> community-based consensus, permissions and deployment permission etiquette.

Here we define the goals of the design for the LPWAN ecosystem:

- Minimize packet collision for uplinks in the same region deployed with multiple
  networks.
- Allocate new resources to the sensors/end devices that need downlink for the networks.
- Enable individual networks to pay for other networks resources and services, i.e.
  network roaming.
- Settle all monetary transactions in MXC.

### 6.2 Design and implementation

The design of the Anti-Collision Coordinator is illustrated in [Figure 5](#fig5). The coordinator
has two responsibilities. The first is to make payments between networks using MXC. The
second is to coordinate between networks about the downlink and uplink status.
In the example illustrated in [Figure 5](#fig5), we see the door lock has successfully bid the downlink
from the MXProtocol at downlink channel 1. However, the network that deployed over 1
km is also using the downlink channel 1 for the garbage sensor, and the pending collision is
obvious. The solution would be that the Anti-Collision.

    alt="anti-collision-coordinator"
    width="70%"
  />
</figure>

Coordinator would pay for Cisco’s network resource, allowing the Gateway to pause
downlink channel 1 for this time’s message, thus allowing the door lock to receive the
“unlock door” confirmation from the cloud.

On the other side, the two networks report each other’s uplink lost message, since the
LoRaWAN protocol has the counter for the uplink. Later, the coordinator finds out that
the majority of the packets that are lost come from both street lighting and the parking
meter due to the fact that their sending intervals are overlapped and they are quite close to
each other.

The coordinator then delays the street light’s sending interval or, alternatively, it changes
the data rate to make sure that they won’t collide with each other, and the fees for a delay
should be paid by the parking meter. Such network coordination is expected to occur
quite often when future deployment of LPWAN sensors becomes more dense. Thus,
the Anti-Collision Coordinator solves the problem of the network resource allocation in
free-licensed bands completely.

### 6.3 Third party integration

The Anti-Collision Coordinator is indeed a protocol plug-in for the LoRaWAN server to
control the Media Access Control (MAC) layer of LoRaWAN uplinks and downlinks.

There are two ways to integrate the Anti-Collision Coordinator into the LPWAN server.
First is to run the full node which integrates the anti-collision mechanism into the protocol
layer like illustrated in [Figure 3](#fig3). Another solution is to run a light node with the
anti-collision module that could be compatible with all the LoRaWAN servers.

As [Figure 6](#fig6) shows, the Anti-Collision Coordinator is essentially a plug-in for the other
LoRaWAN servers that is compatible with LoRaWAN protocol. The plug-in is a protocol enhancement that controls the uplink and downlink based on the payment logic and
resource requirement between two or more networks.

A light node connects to the full node to assign the LPWAN a wallet for sending and
receiving MXCs. The Anti-Collision Coordinator controls the MAC layer for all the
LoRaWAN devices. A separate white paper will be released about the protocol design of
the Anti-Collision Coordinator and its APIs for LoRaWAN servers.

## 7. Inter-Chain Data Market

Currently, there are several traditional data markets that originate from
cryptocurrencies, e.g. Streamr, IOTA and Mobius. All provide a secure mechanism
to make sure that the data stream can be copied and transmitted from the owner
to the consumer in a sequential manner.

Most cryptocurrencies are in need of data. This data is fed into the system to
provide checks and balances, ensuring all players along the chain have performed
their role correctly. For example, a smart contract specifies which goods need
to be delivered from city A to city B and this requires the buyer to pay the
seller, e.g. 10 ETH. So, how can one determine whether the goods have been
successfully delivered? The smart contract must rely on external Oracles from
either the GPS data from the package or the LPWAN tag reading from the
warehouse.

> The entire industry continually requires chains such as Mobius or MXC to feed
> other chains smart contracts and the interdependent information to the
> applications.

Oracles are third party services which are not part of the blockchain consensus
mechanism. The main challenge with Oracles is that people need to trust these
sources of information. Whether a website or a sensor, the source of information
needs to be consistently trustworthy. In order to solve these issues, Oracles
have different trusted computing techniques.

### 7.1 Goals of the design

Blockchains support Oracles in order to assist with fetching external data. The
reason for this comes from the fact that blockchain applications, such as
Bitcoin scripts and smart contracts cannot access and fetch data directly. As a
result, they require pricing feeds for assets and financial applications and
weather-related information for peer-to-peer insurance, all written with smart
contracts. Here we define the goals of the MXProtocol data market with respect
to designing for Oracles:

- Facilitate data usage between different blockchains
- Establish a trusted resource for the external Oracles
- Stack up the data for later purchase
- Enable purchase of a live data stream
- Provide APIs for non-blockchain applications to access the data
- Settle all monetary transfers within MXC

### 7.2 Design and implementation

The MXProtocol Inter-Chain Data Market provides an effective method to feed the
other smart contracts with LPWAN data captured by sensors or end devices.

<a name="fig7"> </a>
<figure>
  <img
    src="./images/fig7_inter_chain_market.png"
    alt="inter-chain-data-market"
    width="70%"
  />
</figure>

[Figure 7](#fig7) shows the example of the transaction between MXProtocol data and blockchains
like Ethereum.

MXProtocol feeds data to Ethereum smart contracts, and gets Ethereum payments as
rewards. It only requires a simple protocol to trust that the data fetched from
the MXProtocol data source is genuine and untampered. In addition to that, the
rich data stream can also be used by external non-blockchain applications via
Web APIs.

Major block chains like Ethereum are short in data for smart contracts, and the data that
is provided by external Oracles essentially may not be trustworthy. With the MXProtocol
Inter-chain data market, the generation and flow of the data can be tracked and verified
publicly on the chain. Hence, the security issue is solved internally with MXProtocol.

### 7.3 Polkadot and Aeternity

Polkadot is essentially a protocol that communicates between different networks.
It solves consensus and transaction delivery between different chains.

Aeternity is created to be the interface between real world data and smart
contracts. Instead of using Oracles that can cause a single point of failure,
Aeternity’s design provides decen- tralized infrastructure for holding and
transferring the data to smart contracts.

The MXProtocol Inter-chain data market uses the idea and mechanism developed by
both Polkadot and Aeternity to deal with consensus, privacy, transaction
delivery and security. A separate white paper will be released about this
design.

## 8. Smart Bidding use cases

### 8.1 Downlink resource auction

Downlink resource auctions occur when it is the only option for the Gateways to
decide which sensor/end devices to communicate with. The Gateway usually has
eight downlink channels, supporting more than 60,000 sensors that need to be
acknowledged in sequence. Uplinks are free for the sensors since all the
Gateways will pick up the packets and forward them within the same network, and
the Anti-Collision Coordinator needs to pay the other network when collisions
need to be avoided. The downlink resources need to be allocated to some sensors
that need downlinks to execute the commands ([See Figure 8](#fig8)). Smart Bidding codes
decide the willingness for the sensor/end devices to pay for the resources, and
all the transactions are settled in MXC.

Both the European and U.S. radio committees impose regulations on the spectrum
access for LPWAN radios using 868/915Mhz bands. These regulations cover issues
from maximum time on air to maximum duty cycle, which, in turn, introduces
waiting times between two packets. For Gateways without Listen-Before-Talk
Technology, this waiting time can range anywhere from a few milliseconds to
minutes depending on the data rate and number of bytes being sent.

<a name="fig8"></a>
<figure>
  <img src="./images/fig8_LPWAN.png" alt="LPWAN" width="70%" />
</figure>

Currently, the downlink resource is distributed on a “first come first served”
basis, which can lead to many potential problems for various devices. For
example, if an electricity monitoring meter were to get downlink priority over a
door lock, the door lock in turn doesn’t receive the confirmation to unlock the
door. The MXProtocol Smart Bidding solves this problem as covered in the
following two aspects:

- Allocate the downlink resource within the same LPWAN using the Smart Bidding
  code snippet for the auction.
- Enable different networks to trade for the downlink resources for the sensors/
  end devices that are willing to pay.

The snippet of code inside the sensors/end devices decides the market prices of the
LPWAN. For a dense Gateway deployment like a city center, the prices can be lower due to
the abundant resources of the downlink channels available. While in the mountains or suburban areas, few sensors would compete for the downlink
resources and thus the prices will rise. The sensors will bid according to the MTBF,
downlink numbers and the density of the network.

The auction method and logic behind the bidding can be programmed by the owner of the
sensor. It is expected that AI-driven algorithms will later be introduced to offer smarter
bidding strategy for the sensors and end devices.

### 8.2 Network coverage market

It is expected that the supply of downlink resources will gradually increase
with the demand of the sensors/end devices. The bidders will pay for the high
prices for the lower Gateway density, which gives SMEs and MNCs incentives to
expand the network coverage to get more MXC coin rewards.

Figure 6 illustrates the market placed by Smart Bidding codes. The prices are
lower at the dense deployment where the two LPWAN coverages overlap, and higher
where there is only one LPWAN coverage.

Some sensors travel around the city. Their code specifies the maximum amount of
coins that it would like to pay for a single downlink. However, they have been
to the places where no LPWAN coverage is available. Once they are back to the
network, they put the last off-chain bid to the chain, and notify the whole
network that they are willing to pay a pre-determined price from the Smart
Bidding code.

The prices and the amount of off-chain bids will surely motivate companies and
individuals to deploy the LPWAN Gateway to the field, thus expanding the network
coverage for the chain. MXProtocol shifts control from telecommunication
conglomerates to companies and individuals by allowing them to deploy their own
LPWAN.

### 8.3 Service market

There are lists of services that LPWAN can provide to the sensors/end devices.
For example, an Over-the-air firmware update should be multi-casted to the
sensors with downlink and it requires the sensors to bid for the resource.

The most attractive aspect of the LPWAN is to implement GPS-free localization,
which also works indoors and underground. In contrast to GPS or SIM card’s high
power consumption and limited reach, LPWAN localization uses the packets sent
by the sensors to calculate the position, which requires no computation from the
resource-limited sensors.

Such a service requires the resources of both a Gateway and the cloud. Hence, the Smart
Bidding code will specify whether it is willing to pay for the service and its accuracy. The
more Gateways that receive the packets, the more accurate the position will be.

LPWAN sometimes needs to change the channel configurations like the arrangement
or the allowed data rate. This kind of coordination will need to be applied globally and the
network will have to try to synchronize such a configuration as much as possible. Smart
Bidding can also accept “free auctions” where they require no one to pay.

Through the MXProtocol Smart Bidding design, it is possible that sensors/end devices pay
for the services that the network offers to them. The outcome of the design will be:

- Some sensors/end devices get the services and the resources that they demand
  through auction
- Network deployment receives reward by offering services and resources to the
  LPWAN sensors/end devices
- All the monetary transactions are done automatically in MXC without human intervention

## 9. Development progress

MXC Foundation’s partner MatchX has released the MatchBox LPWAN Gateway, and
the LPWAN module with development kits. It has reached more than 40 countries with
distributors in Australia, North America, Asia and Europe.

The first Proof-of-Concept has been performed in conjunction with the Stellar
Development Foundation, utilizing the LPWAN coverage and enabling sensors to pay
with each other.
